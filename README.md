# yana - yeat another nostr application

# Motivation
Why yet another client/app when there are so many already being developed?

Current mobile native nostr clients suffer from one of the following:
- UI not responsive enough in older than 1-2 years phones (Amethyst, Plebstr, Nostros)
- lack of a true FOSS community with lots of contributors being welcomed and encouraged to participate (Primal)
- not multi-platform (Damus, Nozzle, Amethyst)

## Multi-platform

I've decided to use flutter to develop the app, so that with one code base it will generate native clients for a lot of platforms.
A big danger with this approach is if somehow the generated code is not as high performance and free of lagging UI as manual native written code for each platform.

## Join

I welcome contributors to the project, specially Designers UI/UX, coders, testers.
If you're not a coder but would like to see something added/implemented, or you have a great idea for a new feature, just don't hesitate to fill up a issue.
