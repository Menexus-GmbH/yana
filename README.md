# yana - yeat another nostr application

# Motivation
Why yet another client/app when there are so many already being developed?

Current mobile native nostr clients suffer from one of the following:
- UI not responsive enough in older than 1-2 years phones (Amethyst, Plebstr, Nostros)
- lack of a true FOSS community with lots of contributors being welcomed and encouraged to participate (Primal)
- not multi-platform (Damus, Nozzle, Amethyst)

## Multi-platform

I've decided to use flutter to develop the app, so that with one code base it will generate native clients for a lot of platforms.\
A big danger with this approach is if somehow the generated code is not as high performance and free of lagging UI as manual native written code for each platform.

## Freedom

It will not be subjective to imperialist rulers, such as Apple Store or Google Store. 
The released app will be distributed as standalone packages for each OS and can be included in free Stores (F-Droid, others?)
User can also just download them from release page and install it directly without a third-party distributor.  

## Join

I welcome contributors to the project, specially Designers UI/UX, coders, testers.\
If you're not a coder but would like to see something added/implemented, or you have a great idea for a new feature, just don't hesitate to fill up a issue.
